# conways-game-of-life

An implementation of John Conway's Game of Life

## Stack

The game logic and rules are purely JS. The UI and controls are React, and the grid is using CSS grid.

## TODO

- Rewrite grid with canvas for performance
- Look into other performance gains
- Mobile display
- Ability to save generations to a list and load them in
- Ability to step backwards?? ðŸ˜²
